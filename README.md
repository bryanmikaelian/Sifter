# Sifter
iPhone App using Sifter's API


This is an early prototype of an iPhone app I built to consume Sifter's API. This app has not been tested under any iOS versions since 4.0.

Since I haven't worked on this in quite sometime, I figured I'd open source it and see where it goes...


## Wish list
* iOS 7+ supports
* CocoaPods
* Bunch of other improvements including design and whatnot.
